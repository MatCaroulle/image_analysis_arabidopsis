# Plant Rosette Segmentation and Radius Measurement

![Plant Rosette](Logo_PL.png)

Welcome to the PhenoLeaf Segmentation project! This repository contains Python and Jupyter Notebook as well as Bash scripts to perform image segmentation and automatically measure the radius of a plant's rosette.

## Features

- **environment.yml**: This file contains all the dependencies (and more) required to execute PhenoLeaf.

- **PL_code.py**: This file contains Python code to segment a plant rosette from an image and measure its radius.
- **Demonstration.ipynb**: This file contains Jupyter notebook to present all the functions. 

- **.sh**: These files contains scripts to apply PL function to large datasets.

- **picture_data_base**: This folder contains images you can pick to use/test the code.
  
- **Efficiency_test**: This folder contains data retaled to a test of the algorithm and R code to analyse its performances.
